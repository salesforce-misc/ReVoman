# ReVoman Development Guide

## Commands to Build and Verify

```bash
# Full build including tests
./gradlew build

# Build without tests
./gradlew assemble

# Run unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run all tests
./gradlew test integrationTest

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test integrationTest --tests "com.salesforce.revoman.integration.pokemon.PokemonTest"

# Run specific test method (unit test -> `test`; integration test -> `integrationTest`)
./gradlew test --tests "com.salesforce.revoman.internal.postman.RegexReplacerTest"

# Compile test classes only (for faster iteration)
./gradlew testClasses

# Fix code formatting
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

## Development Environment

- **JDK**: 21+ required for JVM target
- **Targets**: JVM

## Gradle Wrapper & Offline Builds

- Always prefer `./gradlew` — the wrapper pins Gradle `9.7.0-milestone-2`.
- The repo bundles only the wrapper bootstrap (`gradle/wrapper/*`), NOT the
  ~150MB distribution. A fresh machine downloads the distribution once to
  `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/`, then reuses it — the download is expected, not a bug.
- **Fallback:** if `./gradlew` can't fetch the distribution (offline, or the
  milestone was removed from services.gradle.org), use the machine's installed
  `gradle` instead. Note the local version may differ from the pinned one, so
  build behavior can vary — use only as a last resort.
